pikontroll.ino - to be installed on the Arduino
pikontroll.py - to be installed on the Pi

This is the control system for my PiKon telescope.

Eventually it should also include a version of Silvan Melchior's https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface modified to include UI for steering the telescope.

I think the way this wants to work is pikontroll.py will be responsible for communicating with the Arduino, the web interface will
execute commands using pikontroll.py, and there will be a daemon that Stellarium can connect to which also executes commands using
pikontroll.py.

To implement:
 - pikontroll.py needs to provide command-line access to all of the functions of pikontroll.ino
 - pikontroll.py needs locking so that it is only executing once at a time
 - pikontroll.py needs to support "trim" offsets so we can have 0 step == North even when the motor was not booted up facing
   North, and then the trim is subtracted from every motor command
 - store trim information in a file
 - either pikontroll.py or pikontroll.ino needs some sort of backlash compensation
 - web interface needs to be able to adjust aim angles and trim offsets and communicate them to pikontroll.py
 - daemon needs to be able to receive instructions from stellarium and send back information about current angles as reported
   by pikontroll.py
 - daemon should support setting trim by manually pointing scope at moon, then sending coordinates from Stellarium and marking
   current spot as received coordinates instead of slewing to received coordinates
